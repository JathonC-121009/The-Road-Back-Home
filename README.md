The Road Back Home - RPG Game
The Road Back Home is an appealing RPG-Adventure in which you play the role of Alex-a determined traveler who must make it home in time for Thanksgiving dinner. It becomes more interesting when Alex's car crashes into a tree, and some critical parts disappear. Now, to recover them, you have to explore this mysterious forest, talk with villagers, and successfully solve your quests to piece your car back together.

Story Overview
After the crash, Alex gets conscious to find himself lying in a dense forest. By following every narrow path, you come across a small village full of friendly NPCs. The villagers promise to help you, but only if you can help them first with their chores. Now, your journey for retrieving the car parts is divided into three exciting quests, which are as follows:

Quest 1: Sugar Hunt
The baker of the village requires sugar for the preparation of cake.
Enter the village to speak with NPCs such as the Herbalist and the Merchant to see where the sugar is hidden.
Bring the sugar to the baker in exchange for your missing wheel.
Quest 2: Bandit Rescue
The bandits have stolen the Mechanic's oil canister!
Sneak into the bandit complex, navigate its twists and turns, and retrieve the stolen oil.
Return the oil to the Mechanic in exchange for another of your missing wheels.
Quest 3: Blueberry Maze
The village farmer has promised your missing steering wheel in return for helping him collect 10 hay bales that have been scattered about his blueberry maze.
 Venture into the maze and collect all the hay bales to earn the final quest.
Once all three car parts have been returned, head back to your car to complete the game and make it home in time for Thanksgiving dinner!
